# 1)Start with feature not layout. 
The easiest way to find yourself frustrated and stuck when working on a new
design is to start by trying to “design the app.” When most people think
about “designing the app”, they’re thinking about the shell.

Should it have a top nav, or a sidebar?
Should the navigation items be on the left, or on the right?
Should the page content be in a container, or should it be full-width?
Where should the logo go?  

1. app is collection of feature.Before you’ve
designed a few features, you don’t even have the information you need to
make a decision about how the navigation should work. No wonder it’s
frustrating!
2. For example, say you’re building a flight booking service. You could start
with a feature like “searching for a flight”.

# 2)Details come later.(hold color and don't over invest.)
1. no think of  typefaces,shadows, icons, etc.
2. one trick Jason Fried of Basecamp likes to use is to design on paper using a thick Sharpie.

# 3)Don't Design too much(work in cycle and be pessimist(bel))
Question => 
How should this screen look if the user has 2000 contacts?
Where should the error message go in this form?
How should this calendar look when there are two events scheduled at the
same time?
1. You’re setting yourself up for frustration by trying to figure this stuff out
using only a design tool and your imagination
2. Start by
designing a simple version of the next feature you want to build.
3. If part of a feature is a “nice-to-have”, design it later. Build the simple version
first and you’ll always have something to fall back on.

# 4)Choose a personality
1. Font choice=>  elegant or classic look=> serif typeface and for playful=> rounded sans serif, If you’re going for a plainer look, or want to rely on other elements to provide
the personality, a neutral sans serif works great:
2. color => Blue is safe and familiar — nobody ever complains about blue:
- Gold might say “expensive” and “sophisticated”:
- Pink is a bit more fun, and not so serious:
- third

1. border Radius => small is neutral large is playful and no border radius mean lot more serious or formal:
2. Language => less personal tone might feel more official or professional:

# 5)Limit your choices. 
1. design a system in advance=>color picker every time you need to pick a new shade of blue — choose from a set of 8-10 shades picked out ahead of time.
2. you want system for things like => font size,font weight, line height,color,margin,padding,width,height,box shadows,border radius and opacity.
