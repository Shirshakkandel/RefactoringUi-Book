1. HSL fixes this by representing colors using attributes the human-eye
intuitively perceives: hue, saturation, and lightness.
2. Hue is measured in degrees, where 0° is red, 120° is green, and 240° is blue.
3. Saturation is how colorful or vivid a color looks. 0% saturation is grey (no
color), and 100% saturation is vibrant and intense.
4. Lightness is just what it sounds like — it measures how close a color is to
black or to white. 0% lightness is pure black, 100% lightness is pure white,
and 50% lightness is a pure color at the given hue.


5. You can break a good color palette down into three categories.
6. for primary and accent colors, a
good rule of thumb is to pick a shade that would work well as a button
background.
